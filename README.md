Material Mod
===========

A mod for the popular game Minecraft. Adds many different materials, including ores and their respective tools, and more. Also notable is craftable bedrock and sponge! The mod is server compatible as well, though it requires the client to have the mod.

Installation
------------

To compile, place these files in /forge/mcp/src/minecraft, assuming you've already set up forge. Then run the recompile script for your OS (.sh for Mac/Unix, .cmd for Windows/DOS). You can then run it with startclient, and to install in normal Minecraft run the deobfuscate script, compress the resulting files in the zip format, and call it something like MaterialMod.jar and put it in your mods folder (Mac: ~/Library/minecraft/mods, Windows: %APPDATA%\.minecraft\mods). Forge is obviously a prerequisite. If you need any help, let me know on the Issues section. Eventually I will distribute it compiled already, but it's fairly useless at this point :)

Documentation
-------------

Virtually none at the moment :( Eventually there will be wiki entries, but for now, nothing.
